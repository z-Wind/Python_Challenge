How to get access to the solutions?

You can view the solution only after solving the puzzle. In order to prove that you had solved a puzzle, you would have to enter the URL of the next one, but instead of using pc in the URL, write pcc.

For example, if you are now in http://www.pythonchallenge.com/pc/def/something.html, then change to http://www.pythonchallenge.com/pcc/def/something.html.

If the level requires a password, use the following pattern: http://www.pythonchallenge.com/pcc/somedir/something.html:username:password

Entering this special page will give you a ticket for viewing the solution here. Due to security reasons, the ticket is valid only for 24 hours, but you can always renew it, ofcourse.
